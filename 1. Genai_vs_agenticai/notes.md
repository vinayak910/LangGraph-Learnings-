# Agentic AI vs Generative AI (CampusX Video Notes)

This CampusX video introduces **Agentic AI** by comparing it with **Generative AI (Gen AI)**. The presenter explains how Agentic AI addresses the limitations of Gen AI by being more **proactive**, **context-aware**, and capable of **taking actions**.

---

## 1) What is Generative AI (Gen AI)? (2:18)

* Gen AI models generate **new content** that resembles human-created data.
* Types of content:

  * Text
  * Images
  * Audio
  * Code
  * Video (3:28)

### Examples (4:37)

* ChatGPT
* Google Gemini
* DALL·E
* Midjourney
* Code Llama
* ElevenLabs
* Sora

### Core Idea (10:20)

* Gen AI learns the **distribution of data** and generates new samples from it.

---

## 2) Gen AI vs Traditional AI (7:03)

### Traditional AI (7:55)

* Focuses on finding patterns/relationships between:

  * input → output
* Used for tasks like:

  * classification
  * regression

### Gen AI (10:20)

* Instead of mapping input→output only, it learns the **whole data distribution**
* Generates **realistic and new data/content**

---

## 3) Applications of Gen AI (12:17)

* **Creative & Business Writing** (12:18)
  Blogs, emails, content generation

* **Software Development** (13:49)
  Code auto-completion, debugging

* **Customer Support** (14:36)
  Chatbots for initial customer handling

* **Education** (15:45)
  Doubt solving, personalized curriculum, simplifying topics

* **Designing** (16:45)
  Image generation, video clips, graphics/ads

---

## 4) Problems with Gen AI (Standalone) (28:50)

### Key Limitations

* **Reactive** (29:04)
  Responds only when prompted (not proactive)

* **Lack of Memory** (29:36)
  No long-term context retention

* **Generic Advice** (29:56)
  Not tailored to a company’s internal knowledge

* **Inability to Take Actions** (30:33)
  Cannot perform real actions like sending emails or posting jobs

---

## 5) Improving Gen AI using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) (31:47)

To make Gen AI responses company-specific:

* Connect chatbot with company knowledge base:

  * previous job descriptions
  * hiring strategy docs
  * onboarding docs (31:50)

### Benefit (32:20)

* Answers become **tailored**, not generic.

---

## 6) Problems with RAG-based Chatbot (38:57)

Even after RAG:

* chatbot remains **reactive** (39:04)
* still lacks:

  * workflow awareness
  * memory/context awareness
  * ability to take actions

---

## 7) Tool-Augmented Chatbots (40:13)

Next upgrade: integrate tools so the chatbot can do real tasks.

### Example Tool Integrations

* LinkedIn API for posting jobs (41:05)
* Resume parser tool for reading PDFs (41:15)

✅ This system is called a **Tool Augmented Chatbot**.

---

## 8) Tool Augmented Chatbot Capabilities (41:26)

The chatbot can now:

* Draft job descriptions & post on LinkedIn (42:07)
* Screen resumes automatically (42:49)
* Schedule interviews via emails (43:24)
* Conduct initial interviews (44:20)
* Send offer letters (45:10)
* Assist onboarding (45:51)

### Impact (46:33)

* Reduces repetitive manual HR work
* Automates most of the workflow steps

---

## 9) Remaining Problems with Tool Augmented Chatbots (48:31)

Still not perfect:

* **Reactive** (48:31)

  * user must prompt each step
  * AI does not guide workflow automatically (49:00)

* **No long-term memory/context awareness** (49:25–49:50)

  * every interaction feels like a fresh start
  * user must re-provide context repeatedly

---

## 10) Introducing Agentic AI (50:28)

Agentic AI is introduced to solve:

* reactivity
* memory/context limitations
* lack of autonomous workflow handling

### What Agentic AI Means (50:47–51:25)

* proactive
* goal-oriented
* autonomous decision-making
* uses memory
* can initiate actions based on the overall objective

### Key Strengths

* breaks complex tasks into sub-tasks (52:10)
* reasons about next steps (52:45)
* selects tools automatically
* executes end-to-end workflows

### Example: HR Recruiter Agent (53:20)

A hypothetical Agentic AI HR agent can:

* draft JD
* post job
* shortlist candidates
* schedule interviews
* send offer letters
* onboard employees
  …without needing prompts for every step.

---

## 11) Problems Solved by Agentic AI (57:25)

Agentic AI solves:

* **Proactiveness** (57:25)
  Not only responds, but drives the workflow forward

* **Memory & Context** (57:40)
  Retains information across interactions

* **Generic Advice Problem** (57:55)
  Solved using knowledge base integration (RAG)

* **Action-taking Limitation** (58:10)
  Uses tools autonomously to perform tasks

---

## 12) Conclusion (58:41)

* Agentic AI is the next evolution:

  * beyond content generation
  * towards goal-driven autonomous systems
* Understanding this evolution is important to build advanced AI applications (59:00)
